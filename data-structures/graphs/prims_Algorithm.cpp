Spanning Tree: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/spanning-tree/
1. A Spanning tree does not exist for a disconnected graph.
2. For a connected graph having 'N' vertices then the number of edges in the spanning tree for that graph will be 'N-1'.
3. A Spanning tree does not have any cycle.

Minimum Spanning Tree(MST):
A minimum spanning tree (MST) is defined as a spanning tree that has the minimum weight among all the possible spanning trees.
To find MST, we can make use of Prim's or Kruskal's Algorithm.
